# MatekG474-DShot variant with safety switch disabled
# This variant is designed for DShot 3D ESCs that require immediate output
# at boot without waiting for CAN safety messages

# Disable safety switch requirement
# This allows ESC output immediately at boot without CAN safety messages
# Recommended for:
# - DShot 3D/reversible ESCs
# - PX4 flight controllers (which don't send ardupilot.indication.SafetyState)
# - Applications where safety is controlled via arming rather than safety switch
